            <p style="text-align: justify;">I studied at Harvard University from 2018 to 2020, where I conducted research on QR code encryption. My research
            focused on developing new methods for encrypting QR codes, with the goal of making them more secure and resistant to
            attack. I also worked on developing new tools and techniques for decoding encrypted QR codes. My research has the
            potential to make QR codes more widely used in a variety of applications, such as secure payments and
            authentication. And we did an amazing job with our team. Out team also get awarded for amazing research and team work.

                identify and correct dysfunctional movement patterns. My research focused on the potential of NKE to improve
                athletic performance, reduce pain, and prevent injuries. I am excited to see how NKE develops in the years to come,
                and I believe it has the potential to make a positive impact on the lives of many people.</p>

                    conducted research on artificial intelligence and created software that can observe a human face and recognize their
                    mood. My software uses a variety of techniques, including facial recognition, machine learning, and natural language
                    processing, to identify the emotions of people in images and videos. I am currently working on improving the
                    accuracy of my software and expanding its capabilities. I believe that my software has the potential to be used in a
